This repository contains basic building-block code for controlling robots.

At the moment, it has completed code to:
(1) Turn any Arduino-driven robot that has a light into a DJ metronome that does Chicago house or old skool tempo
(2) Turn any Arduino-driven robot's head back and forth, if the head is on a neck that moves with a single swiveling servo


Currently, in-process:
(1) A personality. GPU code for testing on CUDA.
