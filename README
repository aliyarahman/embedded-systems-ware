This repository contains basic building-block code for controlling real live robots!

At the moment, it has code to:
(1) Turn any Arduino-driven robot that has a light into a DJ metronome that does Chicago house or old skool tempo
(2) Turn any Arduino-driven robot's head back and forth, if the head is on a neck that moves with a single swiveling servo
