This repository contains basic building-block code for embedded C++ used for GNC

At the moment, it has completed code to:
(1) Move any hardware component exactly on beat for Chicago house or old skool tempo
(2) Swivel a cylindrical component back and forth, if that component moves with a single swiveling servo
(3) Recognize faces (Viola-Jones algorithm)
(4) Blur out images it doesn't want to see (box blur algorithm)

In development:
(1) Intuition and personality. GPU code for testing on CUDA.
